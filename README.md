pure prompt played a big role in this. big shoutout to whoever made that. 

setup.sh uses apt package manger because i figured most people are using debian/ubuntu... just replace the couple instances of apt-get with whatever your package manager is, then run it with sudo. seriously tho this is the best shell ever. thanks to those who came before, youre welcome to those who come after. happy hacking.
